## üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†Contributing

We created the Tuva Project to be a place where healthcare data practitioners 
can share their knowledge about doing healthcare analytics.  If you have ideas 
for improvements or find bugs, we highly encourage and welcome feedback! Feel 
free to create an issue or ping us on Slack. 

For information on contributing, please see our [contributions guide](https://thetuvaproject.com/contribution-guides/contributing).

### Getting started with Docusaurus
These instructions walk through how to get set up locally to test and preview 
changes to the docs site. Alternatively, you can create a pull request with your 
changes, and the repo will automatically build a deploy preview using 
[Netlify](https://github.com/apps/netlify).

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. In your terminal, clone this repo and change your directory to the Docs repo. 
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start` or `npx docusaurus start` to deploy the site locally and 
   see your changes.

You can learn more about installing Docusaurus [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation).
