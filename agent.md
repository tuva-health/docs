# The Tuva Project Docs -- AI Agent Guide

The Tuva Project Docs is a docusaurus project contained in the root docs folder which this file is inside of.  The purpose of the docs site is to document the Tuva Project, especially the main Tuva repo.  The docs site is hosted via Netlify and is available on the web at www.thetuvaproject.com.

The site contains data dictionaries for many data tables in the Tuva Project, including:
- Input Layer
- Core Data Model
- Data Marts

The data marts use code that extracts table names, column names, descriptions, and data types from the YML files in the Tuva package.
