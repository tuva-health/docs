This is a presentation my co-founder Coco Zuloaga created a few years ago to help healthcare organizations understand what exactly [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) is and why it's a critical tool for healthcare data and analytics teams.

<!--truncate-->

Healthcare has always been a laggard in terms of adopting new technologies.  Today we see 80-90% of health tech companies adopting dbt, but it's closer to 10-20% for traditional health systems, payers, and pharma.

For many of these organizations it's the same old paradigm: thousands of SQL files saved in file folders across shared drives and local computers, never version-controlled, and orchestrated via stored procedures.

At a high-level, a data team without dbt is like a software engineering team without an IDE or git.  Developing, testing, and sharing code becomes so painful it's practically impossible.

Although we love dbt at Tuva, it isn't the only game in town.  There are a few new tools available now and some older ones as well.  Health Catalyst, my former employer, has a tool that they first developed more than a decade ago that is essentially a simple version of dbt.

Organizations brand new to dbt can have a lot of questions:

- How many projects / repos should we have?
- How should we model our data?
- How and where should we implement data quality testing?
- How and where should we implement automated builds / testing?
- How should we manage larger seed files?

We've helped many healthcare organizations get up and running with dbt the right way, quickly.  If this is you and you'd like to avoid the same mistakes we made over the last few years, ping us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/thetuvaproject/shared_invite/zt-16iz61187-G522Mc2WGA2mHF57e0il0Q) or shoot us [email](https://tuvahealth.com/contact/).
