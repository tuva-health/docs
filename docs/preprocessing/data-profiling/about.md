The Tuva Project's Data Profiling data mart includes approximately 250 data quality tests that are specific to healthcare claims data.  It summarizes the results into a few tables that make it easy to drill into the underlying drivers of your data quality problems.

## Claims Data Quality Issues

The process of generating claims data is heterogeneous and highly variable in nature.  As a result, the claims data you are using for analysis tends to suffer from many different types of data quality issues.  We've found that it's helpful to group the various types of data quality issues into 5 main categories: 

1. Duplicate Claims
2. Claim Type Issues
3. Header Issues
4. Invalid Values
5. Missing Values

### Duplicate Claims
Duplicate records in claims data can occur for different reasons and are very common.  You may have duplicate claims because the method used to transmit claims to you includes duplicate records.  Another cause of duplicate claims is claim adjustments, denials, and reversals.  

Whatever the cause, it's critical to ensure that each claim_id has one and only one value for each claim_line_number e.g. one line 1, one line 2, etc.

### Claim Type Issues
Every claim_id in your dataset should be assigned a valid claim_type, i.e. either 'institutional' or 'professional', and should be assigned one and only one claim_type.  The claim_type is analogous to the claim form.  A lot of downstream data transformation and analytics relies on each claim having an accurate claim_type. 

### Header Issues
As discussed in the previous section on claims data elements, a number of data elements reside on the header portion of the claim.  These data elements should only have a single value for each claim_id.  For example, each institutional claim should have one and only one bill_type_code.  Institutional claims with multiple values for bill_type_code will create problems for downstream processing and analytics.  There are approximately a dozen data elements that exist at the header level on institutional and professional claims that are important to check in this regard.

### Invalid Values
Many fields in claims data have specific reference terminology that determines their acceptable values.  For example, gender is only allowed to take 1 of 3 values: male, female, or unknown.  Downstream processing and analytics depend on the values in these fields being standardized.  

### Missing Values
Missing values are very common in claims data.  It's important to use the claim type to determine whether a value should be missing or not.  For example, bill_type_code should not be populated on professional claims, so a missing value in this case is expected, but it should always be populated on institutional claims.
