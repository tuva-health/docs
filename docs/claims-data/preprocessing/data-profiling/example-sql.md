<details><summary>Summarize all data quality issues by Input Layer table and test_category</summary>

In the example output above, you can see summary results of data quality for each table (column 1)  and each test category.  For example, on row 8 you can see that 8,235 claims from medical_claim had invalid values.  On row 10 you can see 66,196 claims had no data quality issues of any sort (i.e. their test category label was 'good').  

```sql
select *
from data_profiling.summary
order by 1,3
```

<details><summary>Drill into specific data profiling test results</summary>

In this query you can drill into the specific data quality test results.  This table is populated for every test that had at least 1 failure.  For example, on row 11 you can see ms_drg has invalid values on 100% of claims.

```sql
select *
from data_profiling.test_result
order by 1,3,4
```

<details><summary>Drill into specific records in the data with data quality issues</summary>

With this query you can drill into the specific records (e.g. claims) that have data quality issues.  For example, the following query will return all the claim_ids that had an invalid ms_drg_code value.  You can easily join from this table back to your actual claims data in medical_claim to see what values are the issue.

```sql
select *
from data_profiling.test_detail
where test_name = 'ms_drg_code invalid'
```
