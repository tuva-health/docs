title: "Claims Data Model"
---

The Tuva claims data model is a general-purpose claims data model designed to support a variety of healthcare analytics use cases.  It can be used as a common claims data model if you have multiple claims datasets in different schemas and want to merge them into a common format.

The Tuva claims data model also acts as a staging layer for the Tuva Project.  Once you map your claims data to the claims data model, you can run claims preprocessing, which in turn creates the core data model, and then allows you to run all data marts.
