## Methods

[Code on Github](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/tuva_provider_attribution)

Provider attribution assigns each person to the provider who most plausibly
manages their primary care. Organizations use attribution for panel
management, quality and cost performance measurement, contracting,
network optimization, and outreach workflows.

The Tuva Provider Attribution mart implements a transparent, CMS-style
primary-care attribution that runs using only Tuva’s standard inputs
(claims mapped to the Tuva Input Layer, the Core `member_months`, and
Tuva terminology/reference data) - no extra inputs are required.

The logic is inspired by CMS attribution used in ACO/REACH contexts
but generalized to work across all payers and claim types brought into Tuva.
To improve coverage and analytics usability, we add two
additional fallback passes (Steps 4–5) that expand the window and relax
provider classification requirements only after the earlier CMS-like
passes do not yield an assignment.

Specifically, the mart:

- Classifies rendering NPIs as PCP, Specialist, or NPP using NPPES and the Medicare taxonomy crosswalk.
- Identifies primary-care HCPCS services from claims.
- Requires eligibility via member months within the lookback window.
- Applies a five-pass methodology to find the best-fitting provider, adding
  broader fallback behavior only when needed.

### Five-Pass Methodology

For each person, we evaluate providers in ordered passes and select the
first pass that yields any qualifying provider(s). Within the chosen pass,
providers are ranked by highest allowed_amount with a member (fallback to paid_amounts if allowed isn't provided), and then highest number of visits.

1. 12-month PCP/NPP primary-care HCPCS
2. 12-month Specialist primary-care HCPCS (only if Step 1 has no result)
3. 24-month PCP/NPP primary-care HCPCS
4. 24-month Primary-care HCPCS (any provider classification)
5. 24-month Any rendering NPI (fallback when HCPCS-based classification fails)

Windows differ slightly by output:

- Current: The last 12 or 24 calendar months ending on `as_of_date`. See [Current Output Date Behavior and Configuration](#current-output-date-behavior-and-configuration) for defaults and overrides.
- Yearly: Calendar-year windows (Jan..Dec) for the performance year, with expanded windows spanning Jan of Y-1 through Dec of Y (24 months) as a fallback.

The ranking table exposes all qualifying providers and the first pass each
qualifies for. The assignment tables choose the top-ranked provider (rank = 1)
or emit a labeled fallback when no assignable history exists.

### Inputs and Dependencies

- Claims: `core.medical_claim`
- Eligibility: `core.member_months`
- Terminology and value sets:
  - `cms_provider_attribution__primary_care_hcpcs_codes`
  - `cms_provider_attribution__provider_specialty_assignment_codes`
  - `reference_data.calendar`
  - `terminology.provider` (NPPES and taxonomy crosswalk curated by Tuva)

### Current Output Date Behavior and Configuration

The “current” scope uses a data-driven `as_of_date` to define its rolling
12- and 24-month windows:

- Default: the maximum claim_end_date in the attribution claim set, if it is
  not null and is not a future date; otherwise the system date at runtime.
- Override: set the dbt var `provider_attribution_as_of_date` to a `YYYY-MM-DD`
  value to pin `as_of_date`.

Examples:

Pin to a date:

```bash
dbt build --select tag:tuva_provider_attribution \
  --vars '{"provider_attribution_as_of_date":"2025-10-01", "claims_enabled": true}'
```

Use defaults (no var) and enable via global Tuva flags:

```bash
dbt build --select tag:tuva_provider_attribution \
  --vars '{"claims_enabled": true}'
```

Notes:
- Models are enabled when `tuva_provider_attribution` (or `claims_enabled` or
  `tuva_marts_enabled`) evaluates true.
- The “current” output runs for every person with at least one member month
  in the last 12 months ending at `as_of_date`. Persons without assignable
  history receive a labeled fallback row to keep the output grain of the tables at one row for every member with eligibility during the evaluation period.

## Data Dictionary

### assigned_beneficiaries_current

Current, rolling attribution. One row per eligible person and `as_of_date`.
Eligibility requires at least one member month within the last 12 months
ending at `as_of_date`. If a person has no assignable history in the
lookback window, a fallback row is returned with
`provider_id = '9999999999'` and `provider_bucket = 'no_eligible_history'`.

Grain: person_id + as_of_date (via `attribution_key`)

Primary Keys:
- attribution_key

<JsonDataTable jsonPath="nodes.model\.the_tuva_project\.provider_attribution__assigned_beneficiaries_current.columns" />

### assigned_beneficiaries_yearly

Calendar-year attribution. One row per eligible person and performance year.
When there is no assignable history, a labeled fallback row is returned.

Grain: person_id + performance_year (via `attribution_key`)

Primary Keys:
- attribution_key

<JsonDataTable jsonPath="nodes.model\.the_tuva_project\.provider_attribution__assigned_beneficiaries_yearly.columns" />

### provider_ranking

All potential providers per person with the earliest qualifying step and
computed ranking per scope. Includes the lookback window used in ranking,
total allowed_amount, and distinct visit count. Use this table to audit
assignments and to implement alternative tie-breakers or business rules.

Grain: attribution_key + provider_id

Primary Keys:
- attribution_key
- provider_id
