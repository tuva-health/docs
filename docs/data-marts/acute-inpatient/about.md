The Chronic Conditions data mart includes two groupers:

- CMS Chronic Conditions Grouper
- Tuva Chronic Conditions Grouper

The CMS Chronic Conditions Grouper is maintained by the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW).  You can read more about the grouper [here](https://www2.ccwdata.org/web/guest/condition-categories).  

We created the Tuva Chronic Condition Grouper after finding shortcomings with the CMS grouper.  The point of any claims data grouper is to group things (e.g. services, patients, conditions, etc.) into homogeneous classes.  We found certain condition groups as defined by CMS were heterogeneous in nature.  For example, CMS only has a single category for diabetes that combines both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes, despite these conditions having very different pathology.
