## Overview

[Code](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/quality_measures)

The Quality Measures data mart is where we are building publicly available 
quality measures. You can see the roadmap in this section. If there is a 
publicly available measure you would like to see added you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/issues) 
on GitHub.

Check out the Knowledge Base [article](../knowledge-base/quality-measures)
for an overview of the data mart and a walkthrough example for calculating a 
quality measure.

## Instructions

### Data Requirements
This data mart uses the following tables from the Tuva Core Data Model:
- condition
- encounter
- lab_result
- medication
- observation
- patient
- procedure
- medical_claim
- pharmacy_claim

*Note: The Tuva Project will generate these Core tables. You just need to map 
your data to the [input layer](../connectors/input-layer) and run the project.*

### Variables
The data mart includes logic that allows you to choose a measurement period 
end date.

- `quality_measures_period_end` defaults to the current year-end
- `snapshots_enabled` is an *optional* variable that can be enabled to allow
  running the mart for multiple years

To run the data mart without the default, simply add the 
`quality_measures_period_end` variable to your dbt_project.yml file 
or use the `--vars` dbt command. See examples below.

dbt_project.yml:

```yaml
vars:
    quality_measures_period_end: "2020-12-31"
    snapshots_enabled: true
```

dbt command:

```bash
# Uses defaults or vars from project yml, runs all marts
dbt build

# Runs only the Quality Mesures mart using defaults or vars from project yml
dbt build --select tag:quality_measures

# Overrides vars from project yml, executes snapshots
dbt build --select tag:quality_measures --vars '{quality_measures_period_end: "2020-12-31", snapshots_enabled: true}'
```

### Data Mart Structure

**Staging**

The staging tables show what tables and fields are used from the Core data model.

**Intermediate**

The intermediate tables contain the logic for calculating each quality measure. 
The subfolder for each quality measure contains that measure's specific logic for 
calculating the denominator, numerator, and exclusions. Many measures use the 
same logic for calculating exclusions, such as dementia or hospice. This shared 
logic can be found in the shared exclusions subfolder.

**Final**

The final tables are an aggregated view of all quality measures and your 
population.

- **Summary Counts:**  Reporting measure counts with performance rates.
- **Summary Long:**  Long view of the results for the reporting version of all 
  measures. Each row represents the results a measure per patient. A null for 
  the denominator indicates that the patient was not eligible for that measure.
- **Summary Wide:**  Wide view of the results for the reporting version of all 
  measures. This model pivots measures on the patient level (i.e. one row per 
  patient with flags for each measure. The false flags can be treated as care 
  gaps as exclusions have been included in the pivot logic.
