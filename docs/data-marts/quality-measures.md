## Overview

[Code on Github](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/quality_measures)

The Quality Measures data mart is where we are building publicly available quality measures. The following measures are currently built into the data mart, in addition to readmission and AHRQ QIs which are their own data mart.


| Measure Name                                                                   | Measure ID                               | Specification                                                                 | Status                           |

The data mart includes logic that allows you to choose a measurement period end date.

- `quality_measures_period_end` defaults to the current year-end
- `snapshots_enabled` is an *optional* variable that can be enabled to allow
  running the mart for multiple years

To run the data mart without the default, simply add the `quality_measures_period_end` variable to your dbt_project.yml file or use the `--vars` dbt command. See examples below.

dbt_project.yml:

```yaml
vars:
    quality_measures_period_end: "2020-12-31"
    snapshots_enabled: true
```

Quality measures have many standard sections:

- **Measure ID:** Measures can have several different identifiers. These are 
  created by the measure steward (i.e., the organization that authored and 
  maintains the measure). For example, the identifiers for Breast Cancer 
  Screening are NQF 2372, MIPS CQM Quality ID #112, and eCQM CMS125.
- **Measure Description:** A brief description of the purpose of the measure.
- **Denominator:** The population to which the measure applies (i.e., the number 
  of people who should have received a service or action such as a screening). 
  The denominator is the lower part of a fraction used to calculate a rate.
- **Numerator:** The portion of the denominator population that received the 
  service or action for which the measure is quantifying. The numerator is the 
  upper part of a fraction used to calculate a rate.
- **Exclusions/Exceptions:** An exclusion is a reason that removes a patient 
  from both the numerator and denominator because the measure would not 
  appropriately apply to them. Exceptions are due to medical reasons (e.g., 
  patient is comatose), patient reasons (e.g., patient refuses), and system 
  reasons (e.g., shortage of a vaccine).
- **Measure Period:** The timeframe in which the service or action should have 
  occurred.
- **Value Sets:** The healthcare codes used to define the clinical concepts used 
  in the measure. These codes are from standard systems such as ICD-10, CPT, 
  LOINC, RxNorm, SNOMED, etc.
