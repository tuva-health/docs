The Quality Measures data mart is where we're building publicly available quality measures.  We're adding as many publicly available measures as we can to the Tuva Project.  You can see the roadmap in this section. If there is a publicly available 
measure you would like to see added you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/issues) 
on GitHub.
