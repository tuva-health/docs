The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) develops and maintains various measures to assess the quality, safety, and effectiveness of healthcare services [(AHRQ QIs)](https://qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/measures/qi_resources). These measures include the Prevention Quality Indicators [(PQIs)](https://qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/measures/pqi_resources), Inpatient Quality Indicators [(IQIs)](https://qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/measures/iqi_resources), Patient Safety Indicators [(PSIs)](https://qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/measures/psi_resources), and Pediatric Quality Indicators [(PDIs)](https://qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/measures/pdi_resources). They are used by healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers to identify issues, monitor progress, and compare performance to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. 

The PQIs are available now in The Tuva Project. The individual measures and definitions as of the 2023 update are:
