The CCSR data mart implements the HCUP Clinical Classification Software Refined diagnosis and procedure groupers.  You can read more about this grouper [here](https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccsr/ccs_refined.jsp).  HCUP provides a distribution of the algorithm in SAS.  This is an exact copy of the that version that runs using dbt.
