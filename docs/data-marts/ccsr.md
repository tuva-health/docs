The CCSR data mart implements [AHRQ's Clinical Classifications Software Refined](https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccsr/ccs_refined.jsp) diagnosis and procedure grouper.  This is a very commonly used tool to group ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS diagnosis and procedure codes into higher-level categories.
