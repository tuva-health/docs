# Virtual Roadmap

A great place to start understanding the Tuva Project is our virtual roadmap (see static image below).  The virtual roadmap shows the different components of the Tuva Project and how they fit together.  And it shows what stage of development they are in (e.g. released, in development, not started).  For the components that have been released you can click links on the virtual roadmap that will take you to that component's GitHub repository.

Click [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOxvjM5o=/?share_link_id=501071796262) to access the latest most up-to-date virtual roadmap.
