Tuva officially supports the following data warehouses:

- Snowflake
- Google Bigquery
- Amazon Redshift
- Microsoft Fabric

Official support means we have testing of these data warehouses built into our CI/CD pipelines, so every change we commit to the project is tested on these data warehouses.

Tuva unofficially supports several other data warehouses.  This means Tuva will run on these data warehouses, but we don't yet have them added to our CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.  These include:

- Databricks
- Postgres
- AWS Athena
- DuckDB
