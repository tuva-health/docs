We've created a synthetic claims dataset (based on Medicare claims data) to make it easier to develop health analytics if you don't have access to healthcare data.

The dataset is stored on our open S3 bucket.  You can load the dataset to your data warehouse by running [the Tuva Project Demo](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project_demo).

The dataset includes medical claims, pharmacy claims, and eligibility data for 1,000 patients.
