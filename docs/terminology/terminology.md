Terminology includes reference terminology code sets that are necessary to perform healthcare analytics.  These code sets are maintained by many different organizations, updated on various frequencies, and often distributed in ways that make it a pain to load them into your data warehouse.

We're adding as many open source healthcare terminology sets as we can to the Tuva Project.  You can search through and learn about these terminologies in this section.  

To learn how to download terminology sets directly to your data warehouse go [here](../quickstart.md).
