Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) has 158 faw variables that are grouped into 15 measure. These measures are then grouped into 4 themes.
The composite score of the 4 themes is the SVI score.

Themes:
1. Socioeconomic Status
2. Household Composition & Disability
3. Racial & Ethnic Minority Status
4. Housing Type & Transportation

### Area Deprivation Index
Neighborhood Atlas ADI data is based on the Area Deprivation Index is developed by the University of Wisconsin. The ADI is a composite measure of socioeconomic status that includes variables for income, education, employment, and housing quality. 

The ADI is calculated for each census tract in the United States and is then grouped into deciles.  The lower the ADI decile the more affluent the area. ADI provides nationwide score as well as state ranked scores. 

We are not able to host the Area Deprivation Index data due to licensing restrictions.  You can find the ADI data [here](https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/). 

## SVI Maintenance Instructions

1. Acquire SVI CSVs for US tracts and counties.
2. Open in your favorite text editor.
3. Format the contents to Tuva's standards:
	1. Find and replace "-999.0" with "" (null).
	2. Find and replace "-999" with "" (null).
    3. Change all column names to lowercase.
4. Import the CSV file into any data warehouse, casting all columns as varchar/string. (TODO: Note this is based on my observation of [this SVI Tuva example](https://thetuvaproject.com/guides/geo-coding-sdoh). Not sure if it's standard use of this data.)
5. Upload the CSV file from the data warehouse to S3 (credentials with write permissions to the S3 bucket are required)
```sql
-- example code for Snowflake
copy into s3://tuva-public-resources/terminology/svi_[year]_[tract/county].csv
from [table_created_in_step_7]
file_format = (type = csv field_optionally_enclosed_by = '"')
storage_integration = [integration_with_s3_write_permissions]
OVERWRITE = TRUE;
```
6. Create a branch in [docs](https://github.com/tuva-health/docs).  Update the `last_updated` column in [Overview doc](https://github.com/tuva-health/docs/blob/main/docs/terminology/overview.md) with the current date.
13. Submit a pull request.
