Medicare Dual Eligibility is a code found in Medicare eligibility and enrollment data that indicates if a patient is eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.  There are several scenarios that can lead to a patient being eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.  One of the more common scenarios is when an individual is disabled (giving them Medicaid eligibility) and over the age of 65 (giving them Medicare eligibility).
