HCPCS (pronounced "hick picks") are procedure codes used on both professional and institutional claims data, although primarily on professional claims.  There are two levels of HCPCS codes.  Level 1 HCPCS - also known as CPT-4 codes - are maintained by the American Medical Association and are only available if you purchase a license.  Level 2 HCPCS are maintained by CMS.  The codes below are limited to Level 2 HCPCS.
