APR-DRG stands for "All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Grouper".  It was developed by 3M to be an improvement over MS-DRG ("Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Grouper") that was applicable to the entire patient population and not just Medicare patients.  Many payers have switched to using APR-DRG to pay for inpatient hospital stays, however the most commonly used DRG remains MS-DRG.

Every APR-DRG code has up to four severity levels, with severity level 1 being the least severe.
