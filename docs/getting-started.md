Welcome to the Tuva Project!  The Tuva Project is an open source library of data models, data quality tests, and reference terminologies that make it easier to perform analytics and do machine learning on healthcare data.

You can read our manifesto on why we started the Tuva Project here.

The Tuva Project is organized in the following main sections:

- **Connectors:** SQL models that map standard healthcare data formats to the Tuva Input Layer.
- **Terminology:** Reference healthcare terminology code sets and mappings between code sets.
- **Preprocessing:** SQL models for atomic-level data profiling and data transformation.
- **Analytics:** SQL models and value sets for building higher-level concepts, e.g. measures, groupers, cohorts, and treatment regimens.

You can read more about the Tuva Project and how to use it on this website.
