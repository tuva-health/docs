Welcome to the Tuva Project!  The Tuva Project is an open source library of tools for doing analytics and machine learning on healthcare data. 

You can read our manifesto on why we started the Tuva Project here.

Click on the diagram above or the table of contents to the left to learn about the Tuva Project.  

The Tuva Project is organized into four main sections:
- **Connectors:** SQL models that map standard healthcare data sources to the Tuva Input Layer.
- **Terminology:** Reference healthcare terminology code sets and mappings between code sets.
- **Preprocessing:** SQL models for atomic-level data profiling and data transformation.
- **Analytics:** SQL models and value sets for building higher-level concepts, e.g. measures, groupers, cohorts, and treatment regimens.
