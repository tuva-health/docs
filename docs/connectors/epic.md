Epic is the most common electronic health record system in the United States.  Epic comes with two databases: Clarity and Caboodle.  This connector maps Clarity to the Tuva Input Layer.

This is an early release of the connector -- as with any connector we welcome and look forward to community contributions to improve the connector.
