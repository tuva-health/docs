Connectors are code that transform standard healthcare data formats into the Tuva Input Layer so they can be converted into Tuva.  We are building connectors for as many standard healthcare data sources as possible.  We currently have connectors for the following standard data formats listed below.  We welcome the creation of additional connectors by the community!
- [Elation](https://github.com/tuva-health/elation_connector)
- [Health Gorilla](https://github.com/tuva-health/health_gorilla_connector)
- [Medicare CCLF](https://github.com/tuva-health/medicare_cclf_connector)
- [Medicare LDS](https://github.com/tuva-health/medicare_saf_connector)

Additionally, [FHIR Inferno](https://github.com/tuva-health/FHIR_connector) is a python-based utility for flattening FHIR into relational CSVs so they can be converted into Tuva.
