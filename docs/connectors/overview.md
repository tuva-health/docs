# Connectors

Connectors are dbt projects that contain SQL code to transform raw healthcare data formats into the Tuva [Input Layer](input-layer.md).  The Tuva Input Layer acts like a staging layer for the entire Tuva Project.  Once a data source has been properly transformed into the Input Layer the rest of Tuva can be executed with a single command.
