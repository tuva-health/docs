title: "Connectors"

A connector is a dbt package that takes a standard healthcare data format and transforms it to the Tuva Input Layer format.  This takes care of most of the work that's required to run the Tuva Project.  

The Tuva Project currently includes connectors for two standard data formats:
- [Medicare CCLF](/connectors/medicare-cclf)
- [Medicare LDS](/connectors/medicare-lds)

The [setup](/getting-started/setup) section describes how you can use a connector in your dbt project.
