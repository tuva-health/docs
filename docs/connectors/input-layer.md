import { JsonDataTable } from '@site/src/components/JsonDataTable';

The `Input Layer` is like the API for the Tuva data model.  Once raw data sources (e.g. claims and medical records) are mapped to the `Input Layer` code automatically transforms that data into the Tuva data model (i.e. core data model and all the data marts).  

The `Input Layer` is designed to accomodate both claims and clinical data sources.

A patient identifier field named `person_id` has been added to the Tuva data model for both claims and clinical sources. This is a required field and cannot be null. If you bought the Tuva MPI Engine or have your own patient matching solution, this field should be populated with the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). If you do not have a UUID, we recommend mapping the source patient identifier to this field (`member_id` for claims, patient_id for `clincal`).


## Claims Input

### eligibility

The eligibility table includes information about a patient's health insurance coverage and demographics (note: we use the word patient as a synonym for member). Every claims dataset should include some sort of eligibility data, otherwise it's impossible to calculate member months, which are needed to calculate measures like PMPM.  Each record in the table is intended to represent a unique eligibility (i.e. enrollment) span for a patient with a specific health plan.

**Primary Key:**
   * person_id
   * member_id
   * enrollment_start_date
   * enrollment_end_date
   * payer
   * plan
   * data_source

<JsonDataTable jsonPath="nodes.model\.input_layer\.eligibility.columns" />

### medical_claim

The medical_claim table contains information on healthcare services and supplies provided to patients, billed by providers, and paid for by health insurers. It includes information on the provider who rendered the service, the amount paid for the service by the health insurer, and the underlying reason for the service (i.e. diagnosis).  Each record in the table is intended to represent a unique claim line.

**Primary Key:**
  * claim_id
  * claim_line_number
  * data_source

**Foreign Keys:**
  * person_id
  * member_id

<JsonDataTable jsonPath="nodes.model\.input_layer\.medical_claim.columns" />

### pharmacy_claim

The pharmacy_claim table includes information about retail and specialty drug prescriptions that have been filled by a patient, billed by a pharmacy, and paid by an insurer.  Each record in the table is intended to represent a unique claim line.

**Primary Key:**
