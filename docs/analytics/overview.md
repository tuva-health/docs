This section contains a library of data products created with different tools that showcase useful analytics that can serve as templates for Tuva users and community members to create their own insights and analytics on top of the Tuva model. 

We support a variety of analytics tools and visualizations including: 

**Dashboards:** Dynamic visualizations of data that surface key insights, track KPIs and can be filtered or manipulated by end users to get custom insights without complex coding.

**Streamlit Apps:** Similar to dashboards, these highly customizable visualizations are created with a python library called [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). These apps are great for hosting curated analytics in a web interface for easy sharing and publishing, but they require a bit more curation by python developers to create and customize. 

**Notebooks:** Notebooks are great tools for sharing not only visualizations and key results from analyses, but for sharing the thought process, code and workflow required to create them as well. Tuva intends to create a robust library of notebooks that help our community get the most out of the Tuva project, and serve as fantastic re-usable templates for creating your own analytics.
