The CMS chronic conditions grouper is maintained by the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW).  You can read more about the grouper [here](https://www2.ccwdata.org/web/guest/condition-categories).  

We created the Tuva Project's chronic conditions grouper after discovering shortcomings with the CMS grouper.  The point of any claims data grouper is to group things (e.g. services, patients, conditions, etc.) into homogeneous categories.  We found certain condition groups as defined by CMS were heterogeneous in nature.  For example, CMS only has a single category for Diabetes that combines both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes, despite these conditions having very different pathology.
