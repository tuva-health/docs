# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the Tuva Project!  We are the community building the future of healthcare analytics -- a future that is open-source, transparent, and accessible by everyone.

This video provides a short intro to Tuva to get you up and running.

Doing healthcare analytics requires the tools shown in the diagram above.  Most healthcare data teams spend the majority of their time re-inventing and re-building these tools from scratch (we have done this many times).  By open-sourcing these tools, we aim to:

1. Enable healthcare data teams to re-allocate their time and resources away from re-inventing these tools and instead focus on solving more complex problems
2. Build the best set of tools possible by crowdsourcing improvements from across the industry

These docs describe the tools we've built, how to use them, and the use cases they support.

We offer a number of paid solutions built around the open-source.  [Contact us](https://tuvahealth.com/request-a-demo/) to learn more about how we can help your organization.
