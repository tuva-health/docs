# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the Tuva Project!  The goal of the Tuva Project is to democratize access to high-quality healthcare analytics by open-sourcing the tools and knowledge needed to transform and analyze healthcare data.  We are currently focused on building for claims, EHR, FHIR, ADT, and lab data sources.  The tools we've built are shown in the diagram below and documented on this website.

To learn more about why we started the Tuva Project read our manifesto [here](/community/manifesto).

For organizations that need help installing and operating Tuva, we offer a pre-orchestrated, turnkey version called Tuva Enterprise, which we install and manage inside the organization's cloud environment.  Tuva Enterprise includes processing of data feeds and analytics consulting to help the organization get the most out of Tuva.  Contact us [here](https://tuvahealth.com/request-a-demo/) to learn more.
