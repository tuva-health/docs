# 👋 Welcome

Welcome to the Tuva Project! Our goal is to **democratize access to high-quality healthcare analytics** by open-sourcing the tools and knowledge needed to transform raw healthcare data into analytics-ready data. To learn more about why we started the Tuva Project read our manifesto [here](/community/manifesto).

## Why Use Tuva?

Tuva transforms your healthcare data into an analytics-ready data model that enables you to answer critical healthcare analytics questions rapidly.  There are two main reasons why people use Tuva:

1. You need to run analytics across multiple healthcare data sources which come in multiple formats --> **doing this requires a common, analytics-ready data model which Tuva provides.**

2. You want to run all data transformation inside your cloud data warehouse (e.g. Snowflake, Databricks) using [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) so you have 100% control and transparency into data transformation --> **Tuva is the only solution that provides this.**

The heart of the Tuva Project is the Tuva Core Platform -- a dbt package that contains data transformation pipelines, data assets, and data quality tests necessary for doing healthcare analytics.
