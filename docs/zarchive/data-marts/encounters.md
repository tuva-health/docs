This section explains how to group claims into encounters (i.e. distinct visits).

## Acute Inpatient
Analysis of acute inpatient visits is a very common use of claims data.  Many hospital measures, such as length of stay, mortality, and readmission rates all rely on this concept.  However, calculating acute inpatient visits from claims data is non-trivial because a single acute inpatient visit is typically comprised of many claims and there is no field available to link these claims.  For example, the majority of acute inpatient visits will have at least one institutional claim and one professional claim.  Roughly 5% of acute inpatient visits will have multiple institutional claims.
