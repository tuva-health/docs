## What are HCCs?

“HCC” stands for Hierarchical Condition Categories. They are sets of medical 
codes linked to clinical diagnoses that represent costly acute and chronic 
health conditions. CMS designed this model to estimate future healthcare costs 
for patients. HCC coding relies on ICD-10-CM coding to assign risk scores to 
patients.

## What is risk adjustment?

HCCs are part of a risk-adjustment model that CMS uses to calculate payments to 
healthcare organizations for patients insured by Medicare Advantage, Accountable 
Care Organizations, and some Affordable Care Act plans. 

A Risk Adjustment Factor Score (”RAF score”) is a measure of the estimated cost 
of an individual’s care based on demographic factors such as age and gender and 
their associated HCCs. This RAF score is then used to calculate payments or 
reimbursements to these organizations.

## How are risk scores used?

Patients with high-risk scores or multiple chronic conditions are reimbursed at 
higher rates than those with low-risk scores because they are expected to 
require more costly medical interventions. By accounting for differences in 
patient complexity, quality and cost performance can be more appropriately 
measured.

## MMR and MOR Reports

The Monthly Membership Detail Report (MMR) and Model Output Report (MOR) are two types of files that CMS sends to Medicare Advantage organizations (MAOs). The files, in additional to other resources from CMS, are used to calculate the CMS HCC risk adjustment factor (RAF) scores.

CMS shares these files through the Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MARx) system and through the Health Plan Management System (HPMS).

MAOs can refer to the Plan Communications User Guide ([PCUG](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/plan-communications-user-guide-august-31-2023-v172.pdf)) for additional details on the files exchanged through the MARx system.

### Monthly Membership Detail Report (MMR)

The MMRs contain member eligibility, risk scores, and prospective payments the MAO receives for each member in the upcoming month. They also contain retroactive adjustments to prior months’ records. This file contains the data for both Part C and Part D members.

### Model Output Report (MOR)

Similar to MMRs, the MORs contain a record for each member. That record shows the Hierarchical Condition Codes (HCCs) for each member used by the Risk Adjustment System (RAS) to calculate Part C or Part D risk adjustment factors for each beneficiary. There are two varieties of MORs, for Parts C and D respectively, as each uses different models. 

In addition to these monthly files, CMS issues “final” MORs once per year with updated information after the year has ended and planned runout data has been collected.

## Risk Score Models

CMS has implemented multiple models to address differences in program costs and 
the beneficiary population. For example, Medicare Part C versus Medicare Part D 
plans, the ESRD population (End-Stage Renal Disease) versus members without 
ESRD, or members enrolled in the Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly 
(PACE). CMS also segments each model, creating subpopulations with distinct cost 
patterns, such as dual enrollment in Medicaid or living in the community versus 
an institution. 

The full list of models are:

- CMS-HCC
- CMS-HCC-ESRD
- PACE
- RxHCC

In addition to models for different populations, CMS has released versions of 
these models over the years, which include new HCC mappings and added or removed 
ICD-10-CM codes. Version 24 has been in use since 2020. An advanced notice of 
Version 28 was published this year. CMS has finalized a phased transition 
from version 24 to 28, which will begin in 2024 and be completed in 2026. CMS 
also performs model calibration based on diagnostic and expenditure data. These 
changes can be found in the annual rate announcements on [cms.gov](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Announcements-and-Documents).

These models generate risk scores by adding relative risk factors, demographics, 
and disease information. Additionally, they use hierarchies where the most 
severe manifestation of a condition is considered for risk scores.

## Risk Score Calculation

Several resources are needed to calculate risk scores.

- Annual Rate Announcements for the applicable payment year (found on 
  [cms.gov](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Announcements-and-Documents))
- ICD-10-CM to HCC mapping (found on [cms.gov](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/health-plans/medicareadvtgspecratestats/risk-adjustors))
- Risk adjustment model software (CMS makes a SAS program available on 
  [cms.gov](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/health-plans/medicareadvtgspecratestats/risk-adjustors))
- Model Output Report (MOR) or claims data
- Monthly Membership Detail Report or eligibility data

Once you have gathered the resources needed to calculate risk scores, you can 
begin identifying and calculating scores for your patients. A brief overview 
of the steps:

1. Identify demographic and enrollment information for each patient and 
   cross-reference the risk factor value from the appropriate payment year’s 
   rate announcement document.
2. Identify disease information for each patient, apply the condition hierarchy, 
   and cross-reference the risk factor value from the appropriate payment year’s 
   rate announcement document.
3. Identify additional relative and adjustment factors, such as disease and 
   disabled interactions, and cross-reference the risk factor value from the 
   appropriate payment year’s rate announcement document.
4. Calculate the raw risk scores for each patient, then apply the normalization 
   factors and the MA coding pattern adjustment factors from the appropriate 
   payment year’s rate announcement document to calculate the normalized and 
   payment risk scores.

## CMS-HCC Mart in the Tuva Project

As you can see, many resources must be gathered, and the steps to calculate HCCs 
and risk scores are tedious. Most of this important information is not easy to 
find and use since it’s distributed yearly in PDFs from CMS. Many existing 
tools, such as the SAS program or the open-source Python code, were built to 
process one patient at a time. Not to mention that these tools require you to 
have the patient data preprocessed in a certain way.

The CMS HCC data mart is an easy-to-use data mart that can be run with standard 
claims and eligibility data in your chosen data warehouse. We have done all the 
work for you by converting the numerous rate announcement PDFs into CSV seed 
files referenced by the data mart. We created logic to determine a patient's 
demographic risk factors, disease risk factors, interaction factors, and 
hierarchical conditions. All you need to do is choose the payment year you want 
to calculate and the model you want to use.

### Data Requirements

**Eligibility:**

- patient_id
- gender
- birth_date
- enrollment_start_date
- enrollment_end_date
- dual_status_code
- medicare_status_code

**Medical claim:**

- claim_id
- claim_line_number
- claim_type
- patient_id
- claim_start_date
- claim_end_date
- bill_type_code
- hcpcs_code

**Condition\*:**

- claim_id
- patient_id
- normalized_code_type
- normalized_code

*Note: The Tuva Project will generate this table. You just need to run medical claims and eligibility through the project.*

### Variables

The data mart has two variables that allow you to choose which payment year you 
want to calculate and which model you want to use to calculate the risk scores.

- `cms_hcc_payment_year` defaults to the current year
- `cms_hcc_model_version` defaults to Version 24\* (CMS-HCC-V24)

*Note: Version 28 will soon be added as an option.*

To run the data mart, simply update the payment year in your dbt_project.yml 
file or use the `--vars` dbt command. See examples below.

dbt_project.yml:

```yaml
vars:
    cms_hcc_payment_year: 2020
```

dbt command:

```bash
dbt build --vars '{cms_hcc_payment_year: 2020}'
```

### Data Mart Structure

#### Staging

The staging tables show what tables and fields are used from the Core data model.

#### Intermediate

The intermediate tables contain the complex logic to prepare eligibility and 
medical claims data, map to the risk factor seeds, and apply the condition 
hierarchy where some conditions may be dropped if a more severe manifestation of 
the condition is found. The model `cms_hcc__int_hcc_mapping` (aliased as 
`_int_hcc_mapping`) shows all eligible conditions mapped to the HCCs before the 
hierarchy is applied.

#### Final

The final tables are `patient_risk_factors` and `patient_risk_scores`, along 
with snapshots. 

Patient Risk Factors display the final contributing demographic and disease risk 
factors, interactions, and HCCs for each enrollee in the payment year.

Patient Risk Scores show each enrollee's raw risk score, normalized risk score, 
and payment risk score for the payment year.

The snapshot tables are a "look back in time.” You can use these tables to see 
the historical runs of the mart. This is helpful when you want to run multiple 
payment years to compare and trend.
