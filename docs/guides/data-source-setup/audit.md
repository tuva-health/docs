title: "5. Audit"

The purpose of the Audit is to identify mapping problems that are both correctable and uncorrectable and to understand the impact of the uncorrectable problems on downstream analytics.

A series of data tables are built into the data_quality schema that allow you to easily diagnose data quality problems and their impact on downstream analytics.  Here we describe how to query those tables.
