# Claims Mapping Guide
Raw claims data typically suffers from a number of challenges that make it difficult to analyze.  First, it is highly heterogeneous, both in terms of data format and terminology.  For example, even standard fields like ```bill_type_code``` that should only take on a specific set of values may have non-standard values.  

Second, claims data typically has significant data quality problems that make it difficult to determine what is true in the data.  For example, it's not uncommon to see claims with both ```place_of_service_code``` and ```bill_type_code``` populated (which should never happen).

Every organization that deals with claims data develops their own process for dealing with these challenges.  We call this process "Claims Preprocessing" and for us it includes the following:

- Standardizing claims formats to a common data model
- Standardizing claims terminologies
- Systematically identifying data quality issues
- Systematically promoting data we can trust downstream for analytics

This guide describes this process in full detail.

## Overview

There are 5 distinct layers claims data flows through.  Each layer is a well-specified set of data tables.  This guide describes how to map Raw Claims Data to the Input Layer so that it can be 1) tested for data quality issues and 2) transformed for analytics.

![Claims Preprocessing Layers](/img/claims_preprocessing_layers.jpg)

1. **Raw Claims Data:** This is the raw claims data that you get from a payer / health plan.

2. **Input Layer:** This is the layer you map raw claims data to.  This guide describes a set of rules and heuristics for how to map raw claims data to this layer.

3. **Normalized Input Layer:** This layer is automatically created via code that tranforms data from the Input Layer into the Clean Input Layer.

4. **Core Data Model:** This layer is automatically created via code that transforms the Clean Input Layer.  This includes creating new concepts like service categories and encounters.

5. **Data Marts:** This layer is automatically created via code that transforms the Core Data Mart layer.

Other term(s) used throughout this document:

**connector** - A connector is a dbt project that is created to map your raw source data to the Tuva data model that is required to run The Tuva Project.


## Medical Claim

The `medical_claim` table contains the billing information submitted to the health insurer for medical services, supplies, and/or procedures rendered to a member of the health plan.  The primary keys for this table are:

- `claim_id`
- `claim_line_number`
- `data_source`

### claim_id

`claim_id` is a unique identifier for a set of services and supplies rendered by a healthcare provider that has been billed to insurance.  It is the most fundamental data element in the `medical_claim` table and every row should have a `claim_id`.  If the source data does not have claim IDs or is missing claim IDs for some rows in the data, then those rows should not be mapped to Tuva’s input layer.

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`
- `claim_id` is populated for every row
- `claim_id` is unique across all data_sources
- `claim_id` is unique across all lines within a claim


### claim_line_number

`claim_line_number` is a unique identifier within a claim that distinguishes each distinct service, supply, or procedure rendered.  

#### **Mapping**

Every row should have a `claim_line_number`; it must be a positive sequential integer.  `claim_line_number` can be created manually if it’s unavailable in the source data or if it’s not sequential positive integers.  For example:

```sql
row_number() over (partition by claim_id order by claim_end_date) as claim_line_number
```

The max(`claim_line_number`) for a given `claim_id` must be equal to the number of claim lines for that `claim_id`.

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `integer`
- `claim_line_number` is populated for every row
- `claim_line_number` is a positive
- `claim_line_number` is sequential (1,2,3,…)
- The maximum value of `claim_line_number` for is equal to the total number of lines in a claim

### claim_type

`claim_type` is the categorization of a claim based on the nature of the provider and where the services were rendered.  Every `claim_type` is associated with a distinct billing and reimbursement process.

Each `claim_id` must have a unique `claim_type` which should be one of these values:

- `institutional`
    - Providers - Typically healthcare institutions or facilities (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes, hospice, etc) providing healthcare services.
    - Billing - Uses a UB-04 (CMS-1450) form and includes information about room and board, facility fees, etc.
- `professional`
    - Providers - Typically healthcare professionals (e.g. physicians, therapists, practitioners) delivering direct care.
    - Billing - Uses a CMS-1500 form and includes information about specific procedures and services rendered by the healthcare professional.
- `dental`
    - Providers - Typically healthcare professionals credentialed in dentistry (dentists, oral surgeons, orthodontists).
    - Billing - Uses a ADA2012 and includes information about specific procedures and services rendered by the healthcare professional.
- `vision`
    - Providers - Typically healthcare professionals specializing in the field of eye care (ophthalmologists, optometrists, etc).
    - Billing - Uses a CMS-1500 form about specific procedures and services rendered by the healthcare professional.
- `undetermined`
    - This category is used when there is no way to determine the `claim_type` of a claim.

#### **Mapping**

Ideally, `claim_type` is available in the raw medical claim data.  If `claim_type` is not present, other fields in the claim can be used to determine whether the claim is `institutional` or `professional`.

The following fields should only be found on institutional claims:

- `bill_type_code`
- `revenue_center_code`
- `ms_drg_code` or `apr_drg_code`
- `admission_date` and `discharge_date`

Since these fields should only be found on an institutional claim, a value present in any or all of these fields will indicate the `claim_type` should be mapped as `institutional`.

The following field should only be found on professional claims:

- `place_of_service_code`

Since this field should only be found on a professional claim, a value present in this field will indicate the `claim_type` should be mapped as `institutional`.

If both professional-only and institutional-only fields are present on the same claim, we do our best to come up with logic (specific to the data source) that determines the `claim_type` based on the presence of different institutional or professional fields. If it’s not possible to convincingly populate the correct `claim_type`, we map to `undetermined`. 

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`
- `claim_type` is populated for every row and contains one of the values in Tuva’s [claim_type](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/blob/main/seeds/terminology/terminology__claim_type.csv) terminology file
- `claim_type` is the same for all lines within the same `claim_id`

### patient_id and member_id

`patient_id` is a unique identifier that is designed to unify a patient’s records and provide a consistent reference for the specific individual.  It allows for the linking and tracking of a patient’s healthcare journey across different source data sets.

`member_id` is an identifier specific to the health insurer or health plan.  It is assigned by the insurance company to uniquely identify a specific individual only within their system.

#### **Mapping**

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- `patient_id` and `member_id` are populated for every row in the input layer `medical_claim` table.
- `patient_id` and `member_id` have the same value for all lines within the same `claim_id`.
- `patient_id` is unique across all data sources


### payer

`payer` contains the name of the health insurance payer of the claim (Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, etc)

#### **Mapping**

`payer` may not be available in the source data and should be hardcoded (e.g. `select 'aetna' as payer`


**Expectations in the input layer:**

- `payer` is populated for every row
- data type is `string`


### plan

`plan` contains the specific health insurance plan or sub-contract the member is enrolled in (e.g. Aetna Gold, Aetna Bronze 4, BCBS Chicago, etc).

#### **Mapping**

`plan` may not be available in the source data and should be hardcoded (e.g. `select 'aetna bronze 1' as plan` and it can be the same as the payer if no plan is needed for analytics.


**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`
- `plan` is populated for every row


### claim_start_date, claim_end_date, claim_line_start_date, claim_line_end_date, admission_date, discharge_date

`claim_start_date` marks the starting point of healthcare services that were rendered to a patient.

`claim_end_date` marks the conclusions of healthcare services that were rendered to a patient.

`admission_date` is the date that a patient was formally admitted for inpatient care.  It makes the beginning of a patient’s stay in a facility during which they receive medical treatment, monitoring, and other services.

`discharge_date` is the date that a patient is formally released from a facility.

`claim_line_start_date` is the date that a specific line item or service occurred.  For example, during an inpatient stay a patient needs imaging so they are sent to radiology.  This procedure would be a line item on the claim and the date of the procedure would be specified in the `claim_line_start_date`. 

`claim_line_end_date` is the date that a specific line item or service occurred.  For example, during an inpatient stay a patient needs imaging so they are sent to radiology.  This procedure would be a line item on the claim and the date of the procedure would be specified in the `claim_line_end_date`. 

 **Mapping**


**Expectations in the input layer**

When mapping to the input layer, 

- data type is `date` in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`


### Institutional Header Fields: admit_source_code, admit_type_code, discharge_disposition_code, bill_type_code, ms_drg_code, apr_drg_code

On institutional claims, header-level fields are data elements that pertain to the claim as a whole rather than specific claim lines or individual services.  That means that the following fields should be unique per claim:

- `admit_source_code` - the specific location or circumstance from which a patient is admitted.
- `admit_type_code` - a category or description of the circumstance under which a patient is admitted.
- `discharge_disposition_code` - how a patient left a healthcare facility, often indicating where they went or what arrangements were made for post-discharge care.
- `bill_type_code` - a representation of the location and type of service provided to a patient.  In most cases, `bill_type_code` is provided as a 3-digit code but some CMS data sets (e.g. LDS) provide each digit separately.
- `ms_drg_code` - a classification system used by Medicare to categorize inpatient hospital stays and group them based on a patient’s diagnosis, procedures performed, age, sex, and complications or comorbidities.  It is necessary for Medicare reimbursement but often by hospitals as a standard for all inpatient stays.
- `apr_drg_code` - similar to `ms_drg_code` except more detailed and refined.  It is **not** required for Medicare reimbursement and its presence will vary greatly within a data source.

#### **Mapping**

To map these fields to the input layer, there are three elements in the source data that can be used:
- column name - the source data has named their column similar to the Tuva Project
- column description - the source data dictionary provides column descriptions
- column content - the values inside a column match the contents of one of the Tuva terminology files listed above


**Expectations for these header-level fields in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`
- values are mapped to Tuva’s terminology.
    - [admit source](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/blob/main/seeds/terminology/terminology__admit_source.csv)
    - [admit type](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/blob/main/seeds/terminology/terminology__admit_type.csv)
    - [discharge disposition](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/blob/main/seeds/terminology/terminology__discharge_disposition.csv)
    - [bill type](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/blob/main/seeds/terminology/terminology__bill_type.csv)
    - [ms drg](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/blob/main/seeds/terminology/terminology__ms_drg.csv)
    - [apr drg](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/blob/main/seeds/terminology/terminology__apr_drg.csv)


### place_of_service_code

`place_of_service_code` is contains a 2 digit code that specifies a specific location where the medical service was provided.  

`place_of_service` is only found on `professional` claims and is a line-level field that should be populated on all claim lines.

#### Mapping

**Expectations for in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`
- value is mapped to one of the values found to Tuva’s [place of service](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/blob/main/seeds/terminology/terminology__place_of_service.csv) terminology file.


### revenue_center_code

`revenue_center_code` is a 4 digit code that used to classify and identify different departments or units within a healthcare facility.

`revenue_center_code` is only found on `institutional` claims and is a line-level field.  It is generally required for billing so payers understand the nature of a service and can determine proper reimbursement but it can be omitted from source data sets.

#### Mapping

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`
- value is ‘similar’ to one of the values found to Tuva’s [revenue center](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/blob/main/seeds/terminology/terminology__revenue_center.csv) terminology file.


### service_unit_quantity

`service_unit_quanity` provides a measurement or quantification of health services provided to a a patient.  It plays a role in calculating costs and is important for reimbursement.

`service_unit_quanity` is a line level field that can be found on any claim type.

#### Mapping

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `integer`


### hcpcs_code

`hcpcs_code` stands for Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System and represent procedures, services, and supplies provided to a patient.  HCPCS is broken out into two categories:

- Level I - are also known as Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.  CPT codes are crated and managed through the American Medical Association (AMA).  They are often found on professional claims
- Level II - these codes are maintained be the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  They cover a wider range of services such as durable medical equipment (DME) and ambulance services.  These are often found on institutional claims

#### Mapping

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`


### hcpcs modifiers

This includes the following fields: `hcpcs_modifier_1` , … , `hcpcs_modifier_5`

A `hcpcs_modifier` can be an additional code to `hcpcs_code` that provides more information about the circumstances surrounding the service.  They represent specific details about the service.  Some examples are:

- LT - service was performed on left side of body
- 76 - service was repeated by the same physician on the same day
- 77 - service was repeated by another physician on same day

#### Mapping

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`


### rendering_npi, facility_npi, billing_npi

`rendering_npi`, `facility_npi`, and `billing_npi` is populated with the Nation Provider Identifier (NPI) for a provider.

`rendering_npi` represent the practitioner who performed or rendered the specific service.  This value can be populated on either institutional or professional claims.

`facility_npi` represents the healthcare facility or institutional where a specific service was rendered.  This value should only be populated on institutional claims.

`billing_npi` represent the individual or organization responsible for billing and receving payment for healthcare services.

#### Mapping
If only one NPI field is provided in the source data, then reference the NPI in Tuva’s provider terminology file to 
determine if it is a person or a place. If it is a person, then the NPI should be mapped to `rendering_npi` in the input 
layer.  If it is a person and it’s an professional claim then also map to `billing_npi`.  If it is a location and the claim type is institutional, then map to`facility_npi`.

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`


### paid_date

`paid_date` contains the date on which the claim was paid by the health insurer. 

#### Mapping

### allowed_amount

`allowed_amount` is the maximum dollar amount a health insurer will reimburse for a covered medication.

#### Mapping

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `numeric` with two decimal points (e.g. `numeric(38,2)`)


### coinsurance_amount

`coinsurance_amount` is the dollar amount a member has paid for a covered medication as part of cost-sharing with the health insurance provider.  After a deductible is met, covered services may still require a member to pay for a percentage of the cost (e.g. 80/20 - 80% paid by the health insurer and 20% paid by the member)

#### Mapping

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `numeric` with two decimal points (e.g. `numeric(38,2)`)

#### Mapping

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `numeric` with two decimal points (e.g. `numeric(38,2)`)



### diagnosis_code_type

`diagnosis_code_type` contains the coding system for the diagnosis codes contained on the claims.

#### Mapping
On October 1, 2015 the U.S. healthcare industry switched from using ICD-9 to ICD-10.  If the source data does not contain information about the `diagnosis_code_type` then the switch over date can be used to classify the diagnosis codes.  It should be compared against the `claim_end_date`for example:

```sql
case 
	when claim_end_date < 2015-10-01
		then 'icd-9-cm'
	else 'icd-10-cm'
```


**Expectations in the input layer:**

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`


### data_source

`data_source` is populated with the name of the entity providing the data.  It may come from the health insurer directly (e.g. Aetna, BCBS) or a third party (e.g. HealthVerity, Datavant).

#### Mapping


**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`
- `data_source` is populated for every row

## Pharmacy Claim

The pharmacy claim table contains the billing information submitted to the health insurer for medications dispensed to a member of the health plan.  The primary keys for this table are:

- `claim_id`
- `claim_line_number`
- `data_source`

### claim_id

`claim_id` is a unique identifier for a set of services and supplies rendered by a healthcare provider that have been billed to insurance.  It is the most fundamental data element in the `pharmacy_claim` table, and every row in the `pharmacy_claim` table should have a `claim_id`.  If the source data does not have claim IDs or is missing claim IDs for some rows in the data, then those rows should not be mapped to Tuva’s input layer.

#### Mapping

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `string`
- `claim_id` is populated for every row
- `claim_id` is unique across all data_sources
- `claim_id` is unique across all lines within a claim

### claim_line_number

`claim_line_number` is a unique identifier within a claim that distinguishes each distinct service, supply, or procedure rendered.  

#### **Mapping**

Every row should have a `claim_line_number`; it must be a positive sequential integer.  `claim_line_number` can be created manually if it’s unavailable in the source data or if it’s not sequential positive integers.  For example:

```sql
row_number() over (partition by claim_id order by claim_end_date) as claim_line_number
```

The max(`claim_line_number`) for a given `claim_id` must be equal to the number of claim lines for that `claim_id`.

When mapping to the input layer the following expectations must be met or else The Tuva Project will not run and produce errors.  Any row of data that does not meet the requirements must be omitted from the input layer.

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- data type is `integer`
- `claim_line_number` is populated for every row
- `claim_line_number` is a positive
- `claim_line_number` is sequential (1,2,3,…)
- The maximum value of `claim_line_number` for is equal to the total number of lines in a claim


### patient_id and member_id

`patient_id` is a unique identifier that is designed to unify a patient’s records and provide a consistent reference for the specific individual.  
It allows for the linking and tracking of a patient’s healthcare journey across different source data sets.

`member_id` is an identifier specific to the health insurer or health plan.  It is assigned by the insurance company to uniquely identify a specific individual only within their system.

#### **Mapping**

**Expectations in the input layer:**

- `patient_id` and `member_id` are populated for every row in the input layer `medical_claim` table.
- `patient_id` and `member_id` have the same value for all lines within the same `claim_id`.
- `patient_id` is unique across all data sources

### payer
