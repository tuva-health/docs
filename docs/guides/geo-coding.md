description: This guide walks you through how to transform patient data so it's ready for geospatial analytics using publicly available social determinants of health datasets.

## Overview

Geospatial analysis is commonly used in analyzing healthcare data to identify patterns that vary by geography.  In this guide we describe a process for transforming healthcare data to enable geospatial analysis of publicly available social determinants of health data.  Once you follow this guide it's very easy to perform geospatial analysis of any metric (e.g. cost, utilization, outcomes, risk, etc.).

Below is an example of the types of geospatial visualizations that are easily produced by following this process.  This guide doesn't show you how to create this visualization, but it does show you how to transform your data so that you can easily create this sort of visualization on your own.

## Geo-coding

We start with patient data in a Snowflake database.  For each patient we have an address, including street address, city, state, and zip code.  The first step is geo-coding patient addresses i.e. converting them to latitude and longitude.  We use AWS Location Services to perform geo-coding.  Our process has the following workflow: 

![Generic AWS Geocoding Flow](/img/Generic_AWS_Geocoding_Flow.png)

Most of the work in geo-coding involves deploying and managing cloud infrastructure and data pipelines shown in the diagram above.  This infrastructure includes:

- **Snowflake:** Data warehouse that stores all patient data
- **AWS S3:** Cloud storage location where we send outbound data (from Snowflake that needs to be geo-coded) and inbound data (that has been geo-coded and needs to be loaded back into Snowflake)
- **Lambda Address Batcher:** Lambda function that breaks up address data into smaller batches so that AWS Location Services is more performant and sends those batches to the SQS Queue
- **SQS:** Queuing service that holds the batched address data for processing by Lambda and Location services
- **Lambda Geo-coding:** Lambda function that reads messages from the SQS Queue, runs them through AWS Location Services, then writes them back to S3

The [geo-coding](https://github.com/tuva-health/geo-coding) repository contains all the terraform code for creating the infrastructure and python code for the lambda functions upon which AWS Location Services will run.  Instructions for deploying this code can be found in the README of this repository.

After setting up the infrastructure and lambda functions from the geo-coding repo, we need to create an AWS role that allows access to the S3 bucket you want to read from and write to.  Full instructions for setting up the role are [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-config-storage-integration). Then you then need to create a storage integration in Snowflake that uses that role. To create the storage integration:

```sql
create or replace storage integration <NAME>
  TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
  STORAGE_PROVIDER = 'S3'
  ENABLED = TRUE
  STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::<AWSACCOUNTNUM>:role/<ROLENAME>'
  STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('<S3BUCKET>')
```

Please make sure to replace: 
- %lt;NAME%gt;
- %lt;AWSACCOUNTNUM%gt;
- %lt;ROLENAME%gt;
- %lt;S3BUCKET%gt;

Here is an example creation: 

```sql
create or replace storage integration tuva
  TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
  STORAGE_PROVIDER = 'S3'
  ENABLED = TRUE
  STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/aws-tuva-s3'
  STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://s3-example-bucket/')
```

For the rest of this example we will assume that in the terraform code above (from the geo-coding repo) you set your pre-geocode prefix to `/pre_geocode` and your post-geocode prefix to `/post_geocode`.

If you are using the Tuva Data Model you can unload outbound patient data to be geo-coded from Snowflake to AWS S3 with the following SQL:

```sql
copy into s3://s3-example-bucket/pre_geocode/
from (
    select
        PATIENT_ID,
        ADDRESS,
        CITY,
        STATE,
        ZIP_CODE
    from tuva.core.patient
    where address is not null
    )
storage_integration = tuva
file_format = (type = csv COMPRESSION = NONE SKIP_HEADER = 0
field_optionally_enclosed_by = '"')
HEADER = TRUE
overwrite = TRUE
```

The S3 trigger created from the geo-coding repo automatically triggers the geo-coding process.  As soon as patient addresses land in the S3 bucket the lambda address batcher is triggered and processing begins.  Once the geo-coding process has finished (you can monitor this in the AWS Console -> SQS Queue) you can create a table for the raw geo-coded data and read it back in as follows:

```sql
CREATE or replace TABLE tuva.geocoded.raw_geocoded (data VARIANT);
```

```sql
COPY INTO tuva.geocoded.raw_geocoded
FROM s3://s3-example-bucket/post_geocode/
storage_integration = tuva
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'JSON');
```

We then convert the JSON data into a table with separate columns: 

```sql
create or replace table tuva.geocoded.geocoded_patients as (
select data:Patient_id::varchar as Patient_id, data:Latitude as Latitude, data:Longitude as Longitude
from tuva.geocoded.raw_geocoded
);
```

## Census Tracts and Block Groups

Now that our patient data is geo-coded, we can join it to other geographic datasets using geospatial queries.  Here we show how to assign patients to census block groups and census tracts using geospatial joins based on their latitude and longitude.  You can download the census shape files [here](/../terminology/census-shape-files)

In order to create the geospatial tables in Snowflake it requires a special user defined function (UDF). 

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tuva.geocoded.PY_LOAD_GEOFILE(PATH_TO_FILE string, FILENAME string)
returns table (wkb binary, properties object)
language python
runtime_version = 3.8
packages = ('fiona', 'shapely', 'snowflake-snowpark-python')
handler = 'GeoFileReader'
AS $$
from shapely.geometry import shape
from snowflake.snowpark.files import SnowflakeFile
from fiona.io import ZipMemoryFile
class GeoFileReader:
    def process(self, PATH_TO_FILE: str, filename: str):
        with SnowflakeFile.open(PATH_TO_FILE, 'rb') as f:
            with ZipMemoryFile(f) as zip:
                with zip.open(filename) as collection:
                    for record in collection:
                        if (not (record['geometry'] is None)):
                            yield ((shape(record['geometry']).wkb, dict(record['properties'])))
$$;
```
Once you have created the UDF you can use it to load the data into the tables. Here's how you can create a stage in Snowflake to do that:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE tuva.geocoded.CENSUS_BG_STAGE;

grant all PRIVILEGES on stage tuva.geocoded.CENSUS_BG_STAGE to accountadmin;
```
Remember to update the role you need to grant the permissions to. 

Once the stage is created you need to upload the shapefiles to the stage.
```sql
PUT file:///Users/user/Downloads/us-census-tracts.zip @CENSUS_BG_STAGE AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE;
```
Remember to adjust the path in the PUT command to match your download location.

Create the table: 
```sql
create or replace table tuva.reference.census_tracts as
SELECT
to_geography(wkb, True) as geography,
properties
FROM
	table(tuva.core.PY_LOAD_GEOFILE
			(build_scoped_file_url
				(@CENSUS_BG_STAGE, 'us-census-tracts.zip'),
				                   'us-census-tracts.shp')
)
;
```

Next, repeat the process for the census block groups (you can reuse the same stage). 

```sql
PUT file:///Users/user/Downloads/us-census-block-groups.zip @CENSUS_BG_STAGE AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE;

create or replace table tuva.reference.census_block_groups as
SELECT
to_geography(wkb, True) as geography,
properties
FROM
	table(tuva.core.PY_LOAD_GEOFILE
			(build_scoped_file_url
				(@CENSUS_BG_STAGE, 'us-census-block-groups.zip'),
				                   'us-census-block-groups.shp')
);
```

Next we use special geospatial functions to compute whether a specific latitude and longitude combination is within a given census tract or block group.  Note that these functions work in Snowflake but may not be available in every data warehouse. The `GEOGRAPHY` column is a special column that contains a list of points that creates a polygon. 
The function `st_contains` returns TRUE if a specific point exists inside the polygon.  We use the `st_point` function to create that point using the longitude and latitude retrieved from the geo-coding process. 

Census Tracts: 
```sql
create or replace table tuva.geocoded.patient_tracts as (
select a.patient_id::varchar patient_id, b.PROPERTIES:GEOID::STRING FIPS
from tuva.geocoded.geocoded_patients a
join tuva.reference.census_tracts b
on st_contains(GEOGRAPHY, st_point(a.longitude, a.latitude))
);
```

Census Block Groups:
```sql
create or replace table tuva.geocoded.patient_block_groups as (
select a.patient_id::string patient_id, b.PROPERTIES:GEOID::STRING FIPS
from tuva.geocoded.geocoded_patients a
join tuva.reference.census_block_groups b
on st_contains(b.GEOGRAPHY, st_point(a.longitude, a.latitude))
);
```

This part of the query essential says "find the polygon that contains my point." 
```sql
on st_contains(b.GEOGRAPHY, st_point(a.longitude, a.latitude))
```

## Social Determinants

Now that we have transformed patient addresses into latitude and longitude and assigned each latitutde and longitude to a census tract and block group, we now need to join that data to the social determinants data we wish to analyze.  Social determinants of health are commonly analyzed using geospatial techniques because these metrics tend to vary geographically.  

Two publicly available social determinants datasets are the [Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)](../terminology/social-vulnerability-index) and Area Deprivation Index datasets, which contain a variety of metrics calculated at the census tract and census block group levels, respectively.

We make the SVI available for download as part of the Tuva Project.  The ADI requires you to register and download it from the [Neighborhood Atlas](https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/).

In order to load these files you need to first download them.  You can download SVI from the reference dataset bucket, which you can find in the links above.  Once you've done that you need to load them to a stage (you can re-use the same stage from the census files above) and then load them into your data warehouse.
```sql
PUT file:///Users/user/Downloads/SVI2020_US.csv @CENSUS_BG_STAGE AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE;

create or replace table tuva.reference.svi (

## Ready for Analysis

Now that you've 1) geo-coded patient addresses 2) assigned census tract and block groups and 3) loaded social determinants datasets, your data is ready for geospatial analysis.  There are a wide variety of visualization tools, from R and python libraries to dashboards, that make this sort of analysis easy.  We leave the choice of these tools to you as a next step.  But the fruits of this labor are obvious in the SQL statements below.  It's now very simple to join patients, geographic data, and social determinants data for analysis.

SVI:
```sql
create or replace table tuva.geocoded.patient_svi as (
select a.patient_id, b.*
from tuva.geocoded.patient_tracts a
join tuva.reference.svi b
on a.fips = b.fips
);
```

ADI: 
```sql
create or replace table tuva.geocoded.patient_adi as (
select a.patient_id, b.*
from tuva.geocoded.patient_block_groups a
join tuva.reference.adi b
on a.fips = b.fips
);
```
