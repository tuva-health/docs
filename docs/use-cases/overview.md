Use cases are examples of the kinds of research, analytics, and A.I. that are possible with Tuva.  This section is relatively new, so the majority of use cases that are possible are not yet documented here.  

Even still, some of the best use cases have come from the Tuva community!  You can add a use case to an existing page by clicking the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of each page.

While we strive to ensure the queries are written in general-purpose SQL, some may need modification to run on your particular data warehouse.
