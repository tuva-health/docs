Tuva currently has **two EMPI solutions**:

1. **EMPI Lite (current primary offering)**  
   EMPI Lite is a paid product available through the Tuva Marketplace. It is built to deploy quickly (typically **days**), run directly in your warehouse as dbt SQL, and require far less operational overhead than traditional EMPI implementations.  
   We are posting the full EMPI Lite documentation transparently in this docs section.

2. **Legacy EMPI (open-source Tuva EMPI)**  
   The legacy EMPI is a more traditional matching engine built on Splink with a frontend experience. It is still available and useful, but setup and maintenance are typically much heavier (often **months**, similar to traditional enterprise MPI projects).

## Which docs to use

- For new implementations, use the **EMPI Lite** docs in this section.
- For the older open-source implementation, use:
  - [Legacy EMPI Docs](https://tuva-health.github.io/tuva_empi/docs/)
  - [Legacy EMPI Code](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva_empi)

## EMPI Lite at a glance

- Built as warehouse-native dbt SQL
- Faster implementation (days vs months)
- Lower maintenance burden
- Transparent match logic and configuration
