# 👋 Welcome

**Welcome to the Tuva Project's Knowledge Base—our Khan Academy for healthcare data and analytics.**

Becoming a skilled healthcare data and analytics practitioner requires a tremendous amount of domain-specific knowledge, usually gained over years of experience. The goal of the Knowledge Base is to dramatically accelerate that journey, helping anyone become a competent healthcare data analyst in as little as six weeks.

### Learn
Use the Knowledge Base as a structured training program—work through the readings, videos, and exercises start-to-finish. Or, dip in to refresh on specific topics when you need them. Every new Tuva team member completes the full Knowledge Base as part of onboarding.

### Contribute
As you work through the content, you may find areas where your expertise goes deeper than what’s written. Please share it! Contributing is simple—just click the “Edit this page” button at the bottom of any page.
