Welcome to the Tuva Project's Knowledge Base!  Knowledge Base is an open-source book on healthcare data and analytics.  It fully describes how the Tuva Project was built in complete detail.

We modeled Knowledge Base after Hadley Wickham's awesome open-source book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).
