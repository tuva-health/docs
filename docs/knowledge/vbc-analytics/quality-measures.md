Quality measures help us measure or quantify healthcare processes, outcomes, 
patient perceptions, organizational structure, and systems. These measures are 
related to one or more quality goals for health care (e.g., effective, safe, 
efficient, patient-centered, equitable, and timely care). CMS uses quality 
measures in its quality improvement, public reporting, and pay-for-reporting 
programs for specific healthcare providers.

However, value-based care has become synonymous with long lists of quality 
measures that healthcare providers must track and many overlapping programs and 
measure definitions. CMS has launched new “simplified” reporting programs to 
help address these administrative burdens, such as the 
[Alternative Payment Model Performance Pathway (APP)](https://mdinteractive.com/mips-blog/acos-transitioning-ecqm-and-mips-cqm-reporting-start-early-better-results) 
and [ACO REACH](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/aco-reach).

Quality measures are typically developed based on research and clinical practice 
evidence. Measures are developed by:

- Public agencies (e.g., CMS and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality)
- Private nonprofits (e.g., the National Committee for Quality Assurance)
- Professional medical associations
- Private groups

## Components of a Quality Measure

Quality measures have many standard sections:

- **Measure ID:** Measures can have several different identifiers. These are 
  created by the measure steward (i.e., the organization that authored and 
  maintains the measure). For example, the identifiers for Breast Cancer 
  Screening are NQF 2372, MIPS CQM Quality ID #112, and eCQM CMS125.
- **Measure Description:** A brief description of the purpose of the measure.
- **Denominator:** The population to which the measure applies (i.e., the number 
  of people who should have received a service or action such as a screening). 
  The denominator is the lower part of a fraction used to calculate a rate.
- **Numerator:** The portion of the denominator population that received the 
  service or action for which the measure is quantifying. The numerator is the 
  upper part of a fraction used to calculate a rate.
- **Exclusions/Exceptions:** An exclusion is a reason that removes a patient 
  from both the numerator and denominator because the measure would not 
  appropriately apply to them. Exceptions are due to medical reasons (e.g., 
  patient is comatose), patient reasons (e.g., patient refuses), and system 
  reasons (e.g., shortage of a vaccine).
- **Measure Period:** The timeframe in which the service or action should have 
  occurred.
- **Value Sets:** The healthcare codes used to define the clinical concepts used 
  in the measure. These codes are from standard systems such as ICD-10, CPT, 
  LOINC, RxNorm, SNOMED, etc.

## Methodology

Below is a simplified flow chart for calculating a quality measure.

Below is an example of the concepts and logic in the Breast Cancer Screening 
quality measure using the Medicare LDS 5% data set.

## Data Quality Issues

Many organizations that have the technical staff needed to build the logic for 
a quality measure may still run into data quality issues. Some common data 
quality issues are listed below.

- Aggregating and deduplicating data sources.
- Matching patients across these various data sources.
- Missing data or not having enough data:
    - Missing key data points required for the measure, such as date or birth or
      gender.
    - Missing types of data, such as labs or medications.
    - Some measures may go back several years for screening data, such as 
      Colorectal Cancer Screening).
    - Some measures may require other data sources, such as labs or survey data, 
      that are not easy to obtain or work with.
    - Merging claims into encounters to accurately look for institutional stays 
      or residing in a long-term care facility for more than 90 days during the 
      performance period.
- Normalizing healthcare codes to the value set required by the measure.
- Mapping custom data from an EMR, such as observations and report or document 
  tags, to a proper code from the measure value set.

Screening quality measure and common data quality issues that may come up when 
calculating a measure.
