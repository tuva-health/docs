description: The Tuva Project makes it easy to load useful terminology sets like ICD-10 codes directly into your data warehouse where you need them for analytics.

## Overview

Terminology sets are reference code sets and descriptions used in healthcare analytics.  These code sets are maintained by many different organizations, updated on various frequencies, and often distributed in ways that make it a pain to load them into your data warehouse.

We're adding as many open source healthcare terminology sets as we can to the Tuva Project so they are easily available for healthcare analytics in a data warehouse.  You can search through and learn about these terminologies in this section.  If there is a code set you would like to see added you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/issues) on GitHub.

Most of the terminology sets are maintained on GitHub.  However some of the larger sets are maintained on S3.  If you click a link below and it takes you to a file on GitHub that only has a header, that terminology set is maintained on S3.

## Maintenance
The instructions to update each terminology file have been provided below.  Steps may differ based on how often codes are updated.
For example, admit source is rarely updated so optional steps have been included.  This file is also small enough that a person
can manually review the codes for changes.  On the other hand, ICD-10-CM codes are released yearly.  The file is too large 
for manual review and should always be refreshed.

### Admit Source Code
1. Navigate to the [ResDac Inpatient website](https://resdac.org/cms-data/files/ip-ffs)
2. Click "View Data Documentation" under the page title
3. Locate and select the Variable Name "Claim Source Inpatient Admission Code"
4. Open the .txt file at the bottom of the webpage 

Follow steps 5-11 if there are any changes to the admit source codes.  Otherwise, skip to step 12

5. Copy and paste the code list into any text editor
6. Format the codes as a CSV file and save
   - Find and replace "â€”" with a hyphen (-)
7. Import the CSV file into any data warehouse
8. Upload the CSV file from the data warehouse to S3 (credentials with write permissions to the S3 bucket are required)
```sql
-- example code for Snowflake
copy into s3://tuva-public-resources/terminology/admit_source.csv
from [table_created_in_step_7]
file_format = (type = csv field_optionally_enclosed_by = '"')
storage_integration = [integration_with_s3_write_permissions]
OVERWRITE = TRUE;
```
9. Create a branch in [The Tuva Project](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva)
10. Copy and paste the updated codes into the [admit source file](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/blob/main/seeds/terminology/terminology__admit_source.csv)

### MS-DRG
On October 1st, CMS releases a list of MS-DRG codes that are valid for the fiscal year.  This list only contains valid codes
and omits any that have been deprecated.  Tuva maintains these deprecated code so historical data can be analyzed.

1. Navigate to the [CMS MS DRG website](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/ms-drg-classifications-and-software)
2. Under the section "MS-DRG Definitions and Manual and Software", click on "V41 Definitions and Manual Table of Contents - Full Titles - HTML Versions"
    - The version (e.g. V41) will change with each new release.    
3. Click on the hyperlink "Appendix A List of MS-DRGs Version 41.0"
4. Click on the hyperlink ["List of MS-DRGs Version 41.0"](https://www.cms.gov/icd10m/FY2024-version41-fullcode-cms/fullcode_cms/P0380.html)
5. Copy and paste the list of MS-DRGs into any text editor.
6. Format the file
   - Remove the text "MDC" from column 2
   - Wrap the description in column 4 with double quotes so commas are interpreted correctly
7. Save the file
8. Import the file into any data warehouse that also has the previous version of MS-DRG loaded
9. Use the SQL below to populate the `deprecated` and `deprecated_date` columns.  The script does the following:
   1. Compares the old file with the new file to determine if codes have been deprecated.  If they have been, set the column "deprecated" to 1
      and "deprecated_date" to the date the newest codes were published (i.e. the beginning of the current fiscal year)
   2. UNIONs the list of deprecated codes with new valid codes
   3. Cleans up any formatting issues with the output and creates a table.

``` 
-- create table from the output of the script
create table [ms_drg_new] as

-- compare the old codes with the new codes and only return codes that are missing
with depreacted_ms_drg_codes as(
  select
      old.ms_drg_code
      , old.mdc_code
      , old.medical_surgical
      , old.ms_drg_description
      , 1 as deprecated
      , case when deprecated = 0 then '2023-10-01'
          else deprecated_date
    end as deprecated_date
  from [previous_ms_drg_codes] old
  left join [current_ms_drg_codes] new
      on old.ms_drg_code = new.ms_drg_code
  where new.ms_drg_code is null
)

-- union valid codes and depreacted codes together
, union_all_codes as(
select 
  ms_drg_code
  , mdc_code
  , medical_surgical
  , 0 as deprecated
  , null as deprecated_date 
from [current_ms_drg_codes]
where ms_drg_code not in (select ms_drg_code from depreacted_ms_drg_codes)

union all

select
   ms_drg_code
  , mdc_code
  , medical_surgical
  , deprecated
  , deprecated_date
from depreacted_ms_drg_codes
  
)

-- clean up formatting as necessary
select
    trim(ms_drg_code) as ms_drg_code
    , nullif(trim(mdc_code),'') as mdc_code
    , trim(medical_surgical) as medical_surgical
    , trim(ms_drg_description) as ms_drg_description
    , trim(deprecated) as deprecated
    , trim(deprecated_date) as deprecated_date
from union_all_codes

```

### SNOMED-CT to ICD-10-CM Map

This mapping is updated with each new relase of SNOMED CT US Edition which 
happens in March and September, and includes the annual ICD-10-CM update.

The mapping file can be found on the [SNOMED CT United States Edition](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/us_edition.html)
page. Click on the link to download the SNOMED CT to ICD-10-CM Mapping Resources
which includes the human-readable version that contains all required data 
elements in a single TSV file.

The only clean-up required for the Tuva project is to remove the formatting
from the maptarget (ICD-10-CM code) field (e.g. `replace(maptarget,'.','')`).

The HCC Suspecting data mart utilizes the default mapping guidance from NLM which
specifies that the map priority rule of “TRUE” or “OTHERWISE TRUE” should be 
applied if nothing further is known about the patient’s condition. Other 
use-cases may need to further evaluate the map rules that consider a patient's
age, gender, and comorbidities.
