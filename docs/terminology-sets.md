Terminology sets are reference code sets and descriptions used in healthcare analytics.  These code sets are maintained by many different organizations, updated on various frequencies, and often distributed in ways that make it a pain to load them into your data warehouse.

We're adding as many open source healthcare terminology sets as we can to the Tuva Project so they are easily available for healthcare analytics in a data warehouse.  You can search through and learn about these terminologies in this section.  If there is a code set you would like to see added you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/issues) on GitHub.

Most of the terminology sets are maintained on GitHub.  However some of the larger sets are maintained on S3.  If you click a link below and it takes you to a file on GitHub that only has a header, that terminology set is maintained on S3.
