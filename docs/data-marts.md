---

Data marts are code (SQL) that runs on top of (or in the case of claims preprocessing before) the Core Data Model.  Data marts often use clinical concepts or other value sets to define concepts of interest.  

| Data Mart | Description |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| [CCSR](#ccsr) | AHRQ's Clinical Classification Software Refined diagnosis and procedure grouper |
| [Chronic Conditions](#chronic-conditions) | Two chronic condition groupers: CMS and Tuva |
| [Claims Preprocessing](#claims-preprocessing) | Groups claims into distinct encounters and assigns service categories |
| [CMS-HCC](#cms-hcc) | The v24 and v28 CMS-HCC models |
| [ED Classification](#ed-classification) | The NYU ED classification algorithm |
| [Financial PMPM](#financial-pmpm) | Computes member months and data tables for analyzing PMPM |
| [HCC Suspecting](#hcc-suspecting) | Computes suspected HCCs based on historical problems, diagnoses, labs, and medications |
| [Quality Measures](#quality-measures) | Computes various publicly available quality measures |
| [Readmissions](#readmissions) | CMS's readmission measure |
| [Service Categories](#service-categories) | Assigns claims a mutually exclusive and exhaustive service category |

## CCSR
- [Data Dictionary](../data-dictionaries/ccsr)
- [Code](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/ccsr)

The CCSR data mart implements [AHRQ's Clinical Classification Software Refined](https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccsr/ccs_refined.jsp) diagnosis and procedure grouper.  This is a very commonly used tool to group ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS diagnosis and procedure codes into higher-level categories.

## Chronic Conditions
- [Data Dictionary](../data-dictionaries/chronic-conditions)
- [Code](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/chronic_conditions)

The chronic conditions data mart builds two different chronic condition groupers: one defined by CMS and the other defined by Tuva.

## Claims Preprocessing
- [Data Dictionary](../data-dictionaries/claims-preprocessing)
- [Code](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/claims_preprocessing)

The Claims Preprocessing data mart groups claims into distinct encounters and assigns each claim to a mutually exclusive and exhaustive service category.

## CMS-HCC
- [Data Dictionary](../data-dictionaries/cms-hccs)
- [Code](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/cms_hcc)

The CMS-HCC data mart implements v24 and v28 versions of the CMS-HCC risk model.

## ED Classification
- [Data Dictionary](../data-dictionaries/ed-classification)
- [Code](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/ed_classification)

The ED Classification data mart implements the 2017 update to the original NYU ED Classification algorithm to identify potentially preventable ED visits.


## Financial PMPM
- [Data Dictionary](../data-dictionaries/financial-pmpm)
- [Code](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/financial_pmpm)

The Financial PMPM data mart computes member months and stratifies population spend by member month and service category across various payers and plans.

## HCC Suspecting
- [Data Dictionary](../data-dictionaries/hcc-suspecting)
- [Code](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/hcc_suspecting)

The HCC Suspecting data mart identifies patients that are suspected to have an HCC in the payment year but don't presently have one recorded based on historical problems, medications, and lab test results.

## Quality Measures
- [Data Dictionary](../data-dictionaries/quality-measures)
- [Code](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva/tree/main/models/quality_measures)

The Quality Measures data mart is where we're building publicly available quality measurs.  We're adding as many publicly available measures as we can to the Tuva Project.  You can see the roadmap in this section. If there is a publicly available 
measure you would like to see added you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/issues) 
on GitHub.
