# üëã Welcome

Hello and welcome! Thank you so much for taking the time to contribute to the Tuva Project Knowledge Base. People like you have valuable knowledge and experience to share about working with healthcare data and doing healthcare analytics and machine learning.  Sharing your knowledge is a great way to help others analyze healthcare data.

# ü§ù How to contribute

There are two main ways to contribute to Knowledge:

1. Simple Edit via GitHub
2. Advanced Edit via Docusaurus

**Simple Edit:** At the very bottom of every page is a link that says "Edit this page".  Clicking that link will take you to the source code for that page on GitHub.  You can directly edit this code and simply create a pull request.  This approach is great for making edits within an existing page.

**Advanced Edit:** For more advanced changes e.g. building an entire new section, you'll need to install docusaurus, fork the repo, create the changes locally to ensure they build, and then create a pull request.  Here's a [link](https://github.com/tuva-health/knowledge_base) to the repo for Knowledge Base.
