## What Does It Do?

The Data Quality Dashboard takes the output from the data quality tests run by the Tuva dbt package and presents it in an easy-to-understand dashboard. Its main goals are to help you:

1.  **Monitor Overall Health:** Get a quick sense of your data's quality with an A-F grading system.
2.  **Assess Usability:** Understand if specific data marts (like `Service Categories` or `CMS HCCs`) are reliable enough to use based on test results.
3.  **Investigate Issues:** Drill down into specific failing tests to understand *what* went wrong and *where*.

## How It Works: The Big Picture

It's important to understand that the dashboard itself *doesn't run* the data quality tests. 
Instead, it **visualizes the results** generated by the Tuva dbt package.

Here's the typical workflow:

1.  **Run Tests:** You use the [Tuva Health dbt package](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva) (version 0.14.3 or later) within your dbt project to execute data quality tests against your data warehouse.
2.  **Generate Outputs:** The dbt package creates specific tables containing the test results (`data_quality__testing_summary`) and data for visualizations (`data_quality__exploratory_charts`).
3.  **Export Data:** You export these two tables from your data warehouse into CSV files (with headers).
4.  **Import into Dashboard:** You upload these CSV files into the running Data Quality Dashboard application.
5.  **Visualize & Analyze:** The dashboard processes the CSVs and displays the interactive charts, grades, and test details.

## Key Features at a Glance

* **Data Quality Grade:** An overall A-F grade summarizing data health.
* **Data Mart Status:** Clear indicators of usability for each data mart.
* **Detailed Test Results:** See which tests passed or failed, including severity.
* **Quality Dimension Analysis:** Break down results by completeness, validity, etc.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Charts exploring data patterns and quality metrics over time or by category.
* **Report Generation:** Create shareable PDF report cards.
* **Severity Levels:** Tests are categorized by severity to help prioritize fixes:
    * **Level 1:** Critical (prevents dbt build)
    * **Level 2:** Major (affects data reliability)
    * **Level 3:** Moderate (use data with caution)
    * **Level 4:** Minor (limited impact)
    * **Level 5:** Informational (dbt informational tests)

## Getting Started: Running the Dashboard

Here’s how you can get the dashboard running locally. For detailed instructions, 
always refer to the [project's README](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva_dqi/blob/main/README.md).

**Prerequisites:**

* Python (version 3.11 or higher recommended)
* Git

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva_dqi.git
    cd tuva_dqi
    ```
2.  **Set up a Virtual Environment:** (Recommended to avoid dependency conflicts)
    ```bash
    # Navigate into the cloned directory (if you aren't already)
    cd tuva_dqi
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv .venv # Use python3 if 'python' doesn't work
    # Activate the environment
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    # .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
5.  **Access:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

*(Note: Docker instructions are also available in the repository's README if you prefer containerization.)*

## Generating the Input Data (Crucial Step!)

The dashboard needs specific data generated by the Tuva dbt package.

**Prerequisites:**

* A working dbt project.
* Your healthcare data loaded into your data warehouse.

**Steps:**

1.  **Add the Tuva Package:** Ensure your project's `packages.yml` includes the Tuva package, version 0.14.3 or later:
    ```yaml
    packages:
      - package: tuva-health/the_tuva_project
        version: [">=0.14.3"] # Or specify a higher version
    ```
2.  **Install/Update the Package:**
    ```bash
    dbt clean
    dbt deps
    ```
3.  **Run Tuva Models and Tests:** Execute the necessary dbt commands to build Tuva models and run the data quality tests. A typical sequence is:
    ```bash
    dbt seed --full-refresh # Load necessary seed data
    dbt run # Build Tuva models
    dbt test # Run data quality tests
    ```

4.  **Export the Results:** After the `dbt test` command finishes successfully, two key tables will exist in your data warehouse (likely in your dbt data quality schema with Tuva prefix if specified):
    * `data_quality__testing_summary`
    * `data_quality__exploratory_charts`

    You need to **export the data from these two tables into CSV files**, including headers. The method for exporting depends on your specific data warehouse (e.g., using SQL queries, warehouse UI export features, or other tools).

5.  **Upload to Dashboard:** Once you have the `testing_summary.csv` and `exploratory_charts.csv` files, use the "Import Test Results" feature within the running dashboard application to upload them.
