:fire: Welcome to the Tuva Project Slack Community!  Click **[here](https://join.slack.com/t/thetuvaproject/shared_invite/zt-35dtjo7sz-QnTKVZJaEErr35cxFZ2QMA)** to join.

**Purpose:**
This community is for healthcare data practitioners (analysts, researchers, data scientists, informaticists, engineers, etc.).  Healthcare data knowledge is silo’d in organizations within people like us!  This community is a place where we can bring that knowledge out into the open for everyone to learn.

**How to Get Started:**
- Update your profile (e.g. name, picture, what you do, etc.)
- Introduce yourself in **#intros**

**Community Principles:**
- **Intellectual Honesty:** We seek the truth about the best way to solve problems and check our egos at the door
- **Assume Positive Intent:** Helps to keep conversations civil and productive
- **Use Threads:** Helps to keep conversations organized
- **Don’t Post PHI:** Avoid a HIPAA violation :slightly_smiling_face:

**Key Channels:**
- **#announcements:** This is where we post important updates about the project (e.g. releases)
- **#buildersask:** This is where you can ask questions about the Tuva Project (e.g. dbt is giving me a weird error should I do?)
- **#dev-talk:** This is where we discuss work related to improving the Tuva Project code and/or docs
- **#jobs:** This is where you can share links to healthcare data and analytics job openings
- **#news:** This is where you can share articles, podcasts, blogs, etc., related to healthcare data and analytics
- **#plugsandpromos:** This is where you can post about events outside of Tuva
- **#random:** Go nuts :slightly_smiling_face:
- **#tuva-github-updates:** This is for notifications about GitHub issues and PRs in the Tuva Project
