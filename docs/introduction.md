# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the Tuva Project!  We started Tuva to accelerate the creation of population-scale research, analytics, and A.I. from healthcare data (i.e. claims, medical records, and other clinical data).

So what's standing in our way?  Well, as an industry we:

1. Spend most of our time re-inventing and re-building the healthcare analytics stack (see diagram above)
2. Spend any remaining time doing research and analysis
3. Spend zero time doing systematic data quality analysis

The end-result is that we can't trust the few insights we generate.

We're open-sourcing the healthcare analytics stack to stop the cycle of re-inventing and re-building.  These docs describe the Tuva Project, how it's designed, how it works, and how to use it.

We offer support for organizations that need help implementing / operating Tuva on their data.  [Contact us](https://tuvahealth.com/contact/) to learn more about these offerings.
