# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the Tuva Project!  We started Tuva to accelerate the creation of population-scale research, analytics, and A.I. from healthcare data (i.e. claims, medical records, and other clinical data).

So what's standing in our way?  Well, as an industry we:

1. Spend most of our time re-inventing and re-building the healthcare analytics stack
2. Spend any remaining time doing research and analysis
3. Spend zero time doing systematic data quality analysis

The end-result is that we can't trust the few insights we generate.

Tuva is built by healthcare analytics practitioners for healthcare analytics practitioners.  We're open-sourcing the healthcare analytics stack as a first step toward solving this problem.  These docs describe the Tuva Project (i.e. healthcare analytics stack), how it's designed, how it works, and how to use it.

For organizations that need support using Tuva we have two offerings:
- **Data Factory:** A fully-managed version of Tuva in your cloud or ours.
- **Expert Services:** Tap into our experience healthcare data analysts, engineers, informaticists, and scientists to accelerate your data transformation.
