# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the Tuva Project!  The goal of the Tuva Project is to accelerate population-scale healthcare research, analytics, and A.I. by lowering the barrier to the tools and knowledge needed to work with healthcare data.

![Tuva Project Overview](/img/Tuva_Project_Overview4.jpg)

Doing population-scale healthcare research, analytics, and A.I. requires the tools shown in the diagram above.  Most healthcare data teams spend the majority of their time re-inventing and re-building these tools.  By open-sourcing these tools, we aim to:

1. Enable healthcare data teams to re-allocate their time and resources away from re-inventing these tools and instead focus on solving more complex problems
2. Build the best set of tools possible by crowdsourcing improvements from across the industry

These docs describe the tools we've built, how to use them, and the use cases they support.

For organizations that need assistance transforming their data or doing analytics with Tuva, we offer services and support.  [Contact us](https://tuvahealth.com/contact/) to learn more about how we can help your organization.
