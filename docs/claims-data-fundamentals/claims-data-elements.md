## Claim Forms

Healthcare claims are created when a healthcare provider populates a claim form for services or supplies they’ve rendered to a patient.  These days almost all claims are created and submitted electronically.  There are 3 main types of claim forms.  The type of form used depends on the type of healthcare entity submitting the claim.

In this section we’ll cover the key data elements present in claims data.

Each claim form has two sections: a header section and a line section.  Each data element is either entered on the header section or line section.  Every data element in the header section may only be entered a specific number of times (typically one time, but not always).  On the other hand, data elements in the line section may be entered an unlimited number of times.  

## Claims Data Elements

**Billing NPI**
