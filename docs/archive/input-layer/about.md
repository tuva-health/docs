title: "Input Layer"
---

The Input Layer is the base data model for the entire Tuva Project.  Once your healthcare data has been mapped to the Input Layer you can run the entire Tuva Project (i.e. every data mart).  The Input Layer is designed to be easy to map data to.  The current release of the Tuva Project only supports claims data and as such the Input Layer includes 3 tables relevant for claims data.  In a future we will add support for medical records data and expand the Input Layer.

The Input Layer is not intended to be queried for analytics.  It's simply the set of tables that you map your raw healthcare data to.
