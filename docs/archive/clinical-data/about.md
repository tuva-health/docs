title: "Clinical Data"
---

Clinical data is the second category of data the Tuva Project works with.  It includes data that comes from medical records, lab systems, health information exchanges, etc.

To map your clinical data sources to the Tuva Project, map them to the [core staging layer](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project/tree/main/models/core/staging).

We're also building connectors that do this mapping automatically.  So far we've released a single connector for the Elation medical record system.
