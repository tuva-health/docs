The core data model is the foundation of the Tuva data model.  It contains foundational concepts upon which higher-level data marts are created.  The core data model is similar to the Input Layer, but contains several important transformations.  Some examples include:

- Standard terminologies are normalized
- Claims are grouped into encounters and assigned service categories
- Conditions and procedures are pivoted out into "long" tables
